# Simple Shell - **mango**

Welcome to the **mango** simple shell repository! This repository contains the code for a simple version of a shell. With this shell you can run simple commands, including their flags, as well as a few built-ins. You can also enter the full path of a command if you'd like, but that seems like an awful lot of extra amount of work, y'know?
